## 🏆 Winning Consensus Statement

**Group Statement:**

In synthesizing the diverse perspectives on whether voting should be compulsory, we recognize both the potential benefits and drawbacks of such a policy. While some argue that compulsion ensures broader participation and representation, others express concerns about coercion and the possibility of uninformed voting. There is agreement that addressing barriers to voting, such as inaccessibility and voter suppression, is crucial to increasing turnout.

A middle ground could involve exploring incentives for voting rather than penalties, while allowing reasonable exemptions for those unable to vote. Additionally, investing in education and awareness campaigns about the importance of voting can empower individuals to make informed choices without coercion. Ultimately, fostering a culture of participation that respects both individual choice and democratic responsibility is key to strengthening our democracy.

# Consensus Builder Results

**Question:** Should voting be compulsory?

## Original Participant Statements

**Participant 1:**  
I believe voting should not be compulsory. It's a fundamental right, but also a personal choice. Forcing people to vote might lead to uninformed voting which could harm democracy. I think we should focus on making voting easier and educating people on its importance instead.

**Participant 2:**  
I firmly believe that voting should be compulsory. Democracy only works when people participate, and too many people don't vote out of apathy rather than principled objection. In Australia, compulsory voting has led to higher turnout and a more representative government. The civic duty to vote outweighs individual inconvenience.

**Participant 3:**  
While I understand the democratic importance of voting, making it compulsory seems problematic. People shouldn't be forced to participate in a system they might fundamentally disagree with. Instead, we should address the root causes of low voter turnout like inaccessibility, lack of faith in the system, and voter suppression.

**Participant 4:**  
I'm on the fence about compulsory voting. On one hand, it ensures broader representation and forces politicians to appeal to all segments of society. On the other hand, it's coercive and might lead to random voting. Perhaps a middle ground is a small incentive for voting rather than a punishment for not voting.

**Participant 5:**  
Voting should absolutely be compulsory with reasonable exemptions for those who cannot vote. Democracy requires participation, and treating voting as optional has led to lower turnout among disadvantaged groups. Compulsory voting ensures everyone has a stake in the outcome and reduces political polarization by requiring appeal to the majority.
